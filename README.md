# BERT Approach
- Finetuning BERT model is one the efficient and accurate methods to train textual data classifiers, the only thing to consider for BERT model being relatively a large model is that finetuning for a small dataset as the presented one may lead obviously to overfitting behaviour.
- Overall, the notebook displays an easy and intuitive way of finetuning BERT model for classification tasks, all that it needed to to gather more data on the required subject.

# LLM Approach
- The use of Large Language Models such as OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo is indeed a powerful tool because of its general knowledge that can be effectively relied upon for fake news detection. Though, LLMs present a limitation as they are limited to their training cut-off date.
